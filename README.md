# Crestron-SmartThings
This code was originally written by Sytanek.  However, changes made by SmartThings caused issues with the initial release.
Sytanek didn't have time to support the code so I made the corrections required to get it working.  The code currently has
working support for switches, dimmers, and presence sensors.  The code to support locks and thermostats was partially written.  Unfortunately, I don't have either a compatible thermostat or lock to complete this code so I'm putting everything I have up on Github to allow others to continue the work done by Sytanek and myself.
